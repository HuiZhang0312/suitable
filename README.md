# Something to say

First, I created an app on LinkedIn. After tried many times to authenticate with AngularJS but failed,
 I turned to Javascript SDK provided by LinkedIn to implement the authentication and share.

 In order to show how I used AngularJS, I built three other simple apps using AngularJS(weather forecast,
 book gallery and app store).

I tried to push this app to Heroku, but still have some issues. So for now, this app can only run locally.

## About this app
This app is developed using WebStorm supported by Google.
This project is an application for the task for internship in Suitable. co.
